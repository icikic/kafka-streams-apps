# top-n

Top N pages by country example. Based on [top N example](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-streams-examples/blob/4.0.0-post/src/main/java/io/confluent/examples/streams/TopArticlesLambdaExample.java) provided by Confluent.


TODO: Change the frequency of top-n event to match second time window definition
TODO: Try out CMS also, should be easier to use algebird from Java with Scala 2.12 (traits should be compiled to default methods)
